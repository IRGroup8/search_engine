Between 4 and 8 percent of all Americans over the age of 70 would die. 2.2 million Americans would die from the virus itself.", "It gets worse. Most people who are in danger of dying from COVID-19 need to be put on ventilators. 50% of those put on ventilators still die, but the other 50% live. But in an unmitigated epidemic, the need for ventilators would be 30 times the number of ventilators in the United States. Virtually no one who needed a ventilator would get one. 100% of patients who need ventilators would die if they didn\u2019t get one.

However, ", "Researchers further noted that the UK and United States were its primary contexts in modeling, and the third strategy of suppression was strongly recommended based on their COVID-19 trajectory models. In addition, researchers described a projected timeframe for a safe vaccine to be available \u2014\u00a0 a minimum of eighteen months as of March 2020, or September 2021.", "Researchers described intermittent social distancing measures for the duration of time between the report and the anticipated introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine. In that interval of eighteen months or longer, strict social distancing measures were recommended based on \u201ctrends in disease surveillance\u201d whenever an uptick in the number of infections was observed:", "We show that in the UK and US context, suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased absenteeism. ", " We show that ", " \u2013 triggered by trends in disease surveillance \u2013 ", " Last, while experience in China and now South Korea show that suppression is possible in the short term, it remains to be seen whether it is possible long-term, and whether the social and economic costs of the interventions adopted thus far can be reduced.", "Researchers proposed five non-pharmaceutical approaches to the coronavirus pandemic in the context of public health measures.

The main challenge of this approach is that NPIs (and drugs, if available) need to be maintained \u2013 at least intermittently \u2013 for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population, or until a vaccine becomes available.

", "In that excerpt, researchers described an underlying objective for the \u201cmitigation\u201d model and approach \u2014 to reduce the health impacts of an epidemic. Under that model, population immunity builds slowly, and transmission eventually declines.", "The described objective under suppression model involved reducing the number of new cases generated by every extant case to under one. That involved an epidemiological measure known as\u00a0", " (or R-naught), which is the number of people each infected person goes on to infect, on average. Early estimates for the novel strain of coronavirus indicated each infected individual went on to infect two or three other people:", "For disease outbreaks, epidemiologists have a term for describing the average number of people an infected individual will spread an illness to in a susceptible population: it is known as the basic reproduction number, or R0 (pronounced \u201cR-naught\u201d). If the R0 is less than one, the outbreak will fizzle out. If it is greater than one, the outbreak will continue. Early estimates place the R0 for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) in the range of two to three. For comparison, the R0 of SARS (a related coronavirus) was two to four when it caused a deadly outbreak in 2003, and the R0 of measles is 12 to 18.", "Imperial College London researchers used an incubation period of 5.1 days in their model, using a similar R number to the one reported in\u00a0", "\u00a0(\u201ca baseline assumption that R0=2.4 but examine values between 2.0 and 2.6\u201d), and assumed that\u00a0\u201cindividuals are assumed to be immune to re-infection in the short term\u201d following recovery from COVID-19. From there, they used existing figures regarding infection and mortality rates:", "Infection was assumed to be seeded in each country at an exponentially growing rate (with a doubling time of 5 days) from early January 2020, with the rate of seeding being calibrated to give local epidemics which reproduced the observed cumulative number of deaths in GB or the US seen by 14th March 2020.", "Next, researchers discussed a scenario wherein the novel coronavirus strain progressed without intervention, predicting peak mortality three months after the March 2020 report. They noted that such an outcome was \u201cunlikely,\u201d citing the scale of the United States versus the UK as a factor in infection trajectory, as well as a higher population of elderly people in the UK as a factor in mortality rates there.", "Even without accounting for reduced health service capacity thanks to strain on each country\u2019s systems, researchers calculated an expected rate of 2.2 million deaths in the U.S. and 510,000 deaths in the UK:", "In the (unlikely) absence of any control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behaviour, we would expect a peak in mortality (daily deaths) to occur after approximately 3 months. In such scenarios, given an estimated R0 of 2.4, we predict 81% of the GB and US populations would be infected over the course of the epidemic. Epidemic timings are approximate given the limitations of surveillance data in both countries: The epidemic is predicted to be broader in the US than in GB and to peak slightly later. This is due to the larger geographic scale of the US, resulting in more distinct localised epidemics across states than seen across GB. The higher peak in mortality in GB is due to the smaller size of the country and its older population compared with the US. In total, in an unmitigated epidemic, ", "As discussed in many of the summaries shared on social media, on page ten of the report researchers maintained that mitigation was not viable as a strategy, because of its catastrophic effects on health care systems in both countries. As such, they maintained that the suppression strategy was \u201clikely necessary\u201d where possible:", " Our projections show that to be able to reduce R to close to 1 or below, a combination of case isolation, social distancing of the entire population and either household quarantine or school and university closure are required. ", " All four interventions combined are predicted to have the largest effect on transmission. Such an intensive policy is predicted to result in a reduction in critical care requirements from a peak approximately 3 weeks after the interventions are introduced and a decline thereafter while the intervention policies remain in place. While there are many uncertainties in policy effectiveness,", "Researchers routinely mentioned (as did the posts above) that implementation of the suppression strategy would never be adhered to at a perfect rate. They accounted for partial but high compliance with a relaxation of recommended restrictions after several months.", "That suppression model included the closure of schools and universities for months in order to delay a subsequent epidemic during the period before a vaccine became available:", "Once interventions are relaxed (in the example in Figure 3, from September [2020] onwards), infections begin to rise, resulting in a predicted peak epidemic later in the year. The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity.", "Given suppression policies may need to be maintained for many months, we examined the impact of an adaptive policy in which social distancing (plus school and university closure, if used) is only initiated after weekly confirmed case incidence in ICU patients (a group of patients highly likely to be tested) exceeds a certain \u201con\u201d threshold, and is relaxed when ICU case incidence falls below a certain \u201coff\u201d threshold (Figure 4). Case-based policies of home isolation of symptomatic cases and household quarantine (if adopted) are continued throughout.", "Under the modeling scenarios used, suppression policies would be shaped by a fluctuating number of cases. Researchers cited a peak number of cases before capacity for health care services would become overwhelmed and break down:", "Table 3 illustrates that suppression policies are best triggered early in the epidemic, with a cumulative total of 200 ICU cases per week being the latest point at which policies can be triggered and still keep peak ICU demand below GB surge limits in the case of a relatively high R0 value of 2.6. Expected total deaths are also reduced for lower triggers, though deaths for all the policies considered are much lower than for an uncontrolled epidemic. ", " ", "In the \u201cDiscussion\u201d portion of the report, researchers reiterated their recommendations for public health action based on the results of the modeling:", "Overall, our results suggest that population-wide social distancing applied to the population as a whole would have the largest impact; and in combination with other interventions \u2013 notably home isolation of cases and school and university closure \u2013 has the potential to suppress transmission below the threshold of R=1 required to rapidly reduce case incidence.

In a still relatively disruptive mitigation strategy scenario, the high number of projected deaths would be halved, and demand on healthcare services reduced by a still risky two-thirds:", "Long-term suppression may not be a feasible policy option in many countries. ", " The combination of case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions) are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation.
