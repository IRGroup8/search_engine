For instance, the final tally in Dane County, Wisconsin was 338,946. This would count for one county in the 3 column. But why would anyone care to look at this kind of frequency distribution? Data forensic experts use these distributions to investigate fraud. They look at whether empirical distributions of leading digits deviate from a special distribution described by Benford\u2019s Law. The law posits that leading digits of numbers are more likely to be smaller numbers (e.g., 1) than larger numbers (e.g., 9).", "[\u2026]", "Returning to our voting tally in Figure 1, you will see that the tallies deviate from the line of expectation.

", "A 2006 paper [", "] presented at a political methodology conference addressed the application of Benford\u2019s Law alone to evidence claims of election fraud:", " Brady (2005) develops a version of this argument. The basic point is that often precincts are designed to include roughly the same number of voters. If a candidate has roughly the same level of support in all the precincts, which means the candidate\u2019s share of the votes is roughly the same in all the precincts, then the vote counts will have the same first digit in all of the precincts. ", " For Benford\u2019s Law to be satisfied for the first digits of vote counts clearly depends on the occurrence of a fortuitous distribution of precinct sizes and in the alignment of precinct sizes with each candidate\u2019s support. It is difficult to see how there might be some connection to generally occurring political processes. So we may turn to the second significant digits of the vote counts, for which at least there is no similar knock down contrary argument.", "On skeptics.stackexchange.com, one reader\u00a0", " about the Benford\u2019s Law and Biden votes rumor.
