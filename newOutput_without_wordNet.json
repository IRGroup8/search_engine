The results showed the ORF8 and surface glycoprotein could bind to the porphyrin, respectively. At the same time, orf1ab, ORF10, and ORF3a proteins could coordinate attack the heme on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin to dissociate the iron to form the porphyrin. The attack will cause less and less hemoglobin that can carry oxygen and carbon dioxide. The lung cells have extremely intense poisoning and inflammatory due to the inability to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen frequently, which eventually results in ground-glass-like lung images. The mechanism also interfered with the normal heme anabolic pathway of the human body, is expected to result in human disease.

For comparison, the R0 of SARS (a related coronavirus) was two to four when it caused a deadly outbreak in 2003, and the R0 of measles is 12 to 18.", "Imperial College London researchers used an incubation period of 5.1 days in their model, using a similar R number to the one reported in\u00a0", "\u00a0(\u201ca baseline assumption that R0=2.4 but examine values between 2.0 and 2.6\u201d), and assumed that\u00a0\u201cindividuals are assumed to be immune to re-infection in the short term\u201d following recovery from COVID-19. From there, they used existing figures regarding infection and mortality rates:", "Infection was assumed to be seeded in each country at an exponentially growing rate (with a doubling time of 5 days) from early January 2020, with the rate of seeding being calibrated to give local epidemics which reproduced the observed cumulative number of deaths in GB or the US seen by 14th March 2020.", "Next, researchers discussed a scenario wherein the novel coronavirus strain progressed without intervention, predicting peak mortality three months after the March 2020 report. They noted that such an outcome was \u201cunlikely,\u201d citing the scale of the United States versus the UK as a factor in infection trajectory, as well as a higher population of elderly people in the UK as a factor in mortality rates there.", "Even without accounting for reduced health service capacity thanks to strain on each country\u2019s systems, researchers calculated an expected rate of 2.2 million deaths in the U.S. and 510,000 deaths in the UK:", "In the (unlikely) absence of any control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behaviour, we would expect a peak in mortality (daily deaths) to occur after approximately 3 months. In such scenarios, given an estimated R0 of 2.4, we predict 81% of the GB and US populations would be infected over the course of the epidemic. Epidemic timings are approximate given the limitations of surveillance data in both countries: The epidemic is predicted to be broader in the US than in GB and to peak slightly later. This is due to the larger geographic scale of the US, resulting in more distinct localised epidemics across states than seen across GB. The higher peak in mortality in GB is due to the smaller size of the country and its older population compared with the US. In total, in an unmitigated epidemic, ", "As discussed in many of the summaries shared on social media, on page ten of the report researchers maintained that mitigation was not viable as a strategy, because of its catastrophic effects on health care systems in both countries. As such, they maintained that the suppression strategy was \u201clikely necessary\u201d where possible:", " Our projections show that to be able to reduce R to close to 1 or below, a combination of case isolation, social distancing of the entire population and either household quarantine or school and university closure are required. ", " All four interventions combined are predicted to have the largest effect on transmission. Such an intensive policy is predicted to result in a reduction in critical care requirements from a peak approximately 3 weeks after the interventions are introduced and a decline thereafter while the intervention policies remain in place. While there are many uncertainties in policy effectiveness,", "Researchers routinely mentioned (as did the posts above) that implementation of the suppression strategy would never be adhered to at a perfect rate. They accounted for partial but high compliance with a relaxation of recommended restrictions after several months.", "That suppression model included the closure of schools and universities for months in order to delay a subsequent epidemic during the period before a vaccine became available:", "Once interventions are relaxed (in the example in Figure 3, from September [2020] onwards), infections begin to rise, resulting in a predicted peak epidemic later in the year. The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity.", "Given suppression policies may need to be maintained for many months, we examined the impact of an adaptive policy in which social distancing (plus school and university closure, if used) is only initiated after weekly confirmed case incidence in ICU patients (a group of patients highly likely to be tested) exceeds a certain \u201con\u201d threshold, and is relaxed when ICU case incidence falls below a certain \u201coff\u201d threshold (Figure 4). Case-based policies of home isolation of symptomatic cases and household quarantine (if adopted) are continued throughout.", "Under the modeling scenarios used, suppression policies would be shaped by a fluctuating number of cases. Researchers cited a peak number of cases before capacity for health care services would become overwhelmed and break down:", "Table 3 illustrates that suppression policies are best triggered early in the epidemic, with a cumulative total of 200 ICU cases per week being the latest point at which policies can be triggered and still keep peak ICU demand below GB surge limits in the case of a relatively high R0 value of 2.6. Expected total deaths are also reduced for lower triggers, though deaths for all the policies considered are much lower than for an uncontrolled epidemic. ", " ", "In the \u201cDiscussion\u201d portion of the report, researchers reiterated their recommendations for public health action based on the results of the modeling:", "Overall, our results suggest that population-wide social distancing applied to the population as a whole would have the largest impact; and in combination with other interventions \u2013 notably home isolation of cases and school and university closure \u2013 has the potential to suppress transmission below the threshold of R=1 required to rapidly reduce case incidence. ", " Adaptive hospital surveillance-based triggers for switching on and off population-wide social distancing and school closure offer greater robustness to uncertainty than fixed duration interventions and can be adapted for regional use (e.g. at the state level in the US). Given local epidemics are not perfectly synchronised, local policies are also more efficient and can achieve comparable levels of suppression to national policies while being in force for a slightly smaller proportion of the time. However, ", "A phrase you may have seen before (and after) the Imperial College London report\u2019s appearance is \u201cflattening the curve,\u201d a reference to COVID-19\u2019s \u201cepidemic curve,\u201d as it relates to the capacity of any country\u2019s health care resources in times of vastly increased demand.", "Social media users probably saw a graph very much like the one below from ", "; the graph depicts a dashed horizontal line representing the capacity of health care systems in general:", "A vertical axis on the graph represented \u201cnumber of cases,\u201d and a horizontal axis \u201ctime since first case.\u201d \u201cFlattening the curve\u201d described spacing out the rate of infections to a degree sufficient that the dotted line \u2014 system capacity \u2014 would not be exceeded by the number of cases requiring the system\u2019s resources.", "By spacing out the rate of infection (or flattening the curve of infections), health care system capacity was less likely to be exceeded. Imperial College London\u2019s research was predicated in part on flattening the curve for COVID-19, and circumventing a scenario in which capacity was exceeded by unchecked person-to-person spread of the virus.", "Researchers noted that because the strain was new, information and knowledge about the novel coronavirus would be in flux until there was more data. Consequently, they maintained that policies of suppression might change over time \u2014 but not for \u201cseveral months\u201d at least. The researchers also warned that premature relaxation of suppression measures could cause cases of COVID-19 to rapidly rebound, once again threatening to overwhelm health care systems.", "That risk, again, remained until such time a vaccine became widely available:", "However, there are very large uncertainties around the transmission of this virus, the likely effectiveness of different policies and the extent to which the population spontaneously adopts risk reducing behaviours. This means ", ". Future decisions on when and for how long to relax policies will need to be informed by ongoing surveillance.", "The measures used to achieve suppression might also evolve over time. As case numbers fall, it becomes more feasible to adopt intensive testing, contact tracing and quarantine measures akin to the strategies being employed in South Korea today. Technology \u2013 such as mobile phone apps that track an individual\u2019s interactions with other people in society \u2013 might allow such a policy to be more effective and scalable if the associated privacy concerns can be overcome. However, if intensive NPI packages aimed at suppression are not maintained, our analysis suggests that transmission will rapidly rebound, potentially producing an epidemic comparable in scale to what would have been seen had no interventions been adopted.", "The report also indicated that the duration of suppression policies required might be too difficult to implement, discussing the relative efficacy of mitigation versus suppression. In a still relatively disruptive mitigation strategy scenario, the high number of projected deaths would be halved, and demand on healthcare services reduced by a still risky two-thirds:", "Long-term suppression may not be a feasible policy option in many countries. ", " The combination of case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions) are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation. Both case isolation and household quarantine are core epidemiological interventions for infectious disease mitigation and act by reducing the potential for onward transmission through reducing the contact rates of those that are known to be infectious (cases) or may be harbouring infection (household contacts) \u2026 Social distancing of high-risk groups is predicted to be particularly effective at reducing severe outcomes given the strong evidence of an increased risk with age, though we predict it would have less effect in reducing population transmission.", "Researchers reiterated a bleak projected outcome with mitigation strategies in place. Although they anticipated a \u201csingle\u201d and \u201crelatively short\u201d epidemic, health care capacity would be exceeded eight times over, and deaths would number a quarter of a million or more in the UK, and more than a million in the United States:", " (case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of the elderly), ", " for critical care requirements that we examined. In addition, ", "In its final paragraphs, researchers said suppression was \u201cthe only viable strategy\u201d as of the publication of their report. They said the measures required to implement suppression were \u201cprofound,\u201d but required countries to implement them \u201cimminently\u201d:", " The social and economic effects of the measures which are needed to achieve this policy goal will be profound. Many countries have adopted such measures already, but even those countries at an earlier stage of their epidemic (such as the UK) will need to do so imminently.", "Several expert responses are published ", ".", "On March 16 2020, researchers from Imperial College London published \u201cImpact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand,\u201d projecting several possible outcomes for the coronavirus pandemic in the following months.", "In social media discourse, three of the possible outcomes were discussed \u2014 taking no measures or \u201cdoing nothing,\u201d mitigation, and a stricter strategy of suppressing COVID-19 cases to a rate of reproduction less than one.

Researchers predicted more than a million deaths in the United States alone even under the \u201cmitigation\u201d model with many public health restrictions, and they also emphasized that they believed the stricter \u201csuppression\u201d model was the only viable approach.
