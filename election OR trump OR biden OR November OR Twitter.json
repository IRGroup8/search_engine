Ginsburg died on September 18 2020, 46 days before the 2020 Election. To date, Taney\u2019s death on the bench was historically the closest in proximity to a looming election. By all accounts, Lincoln\u2019s post-election appointment of Chase was a far less pressing issue due to the fact the Civil War did not end until 1865.", "A law review article from 1981 [", "] cited by PolitiFact addressed the political climate at the time of the 1864 election, as well as the dynamic between Chase and Lincoln:", "During the campaign Roger B. Taney, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, died. His death on October 12 required Lincoln to replace a jurist who had served on the Court for twenty-eight years. The President was not without candidates. Associate Supreme Court Justice Noah Swayne and Postmaster-General Montgomery Blair both vied for the position. Senator Charles Sumner supported Chase and along with other Republicans urged his appointment. Chase, who had as early as 1863 indicated his interest in the Chief Justice position, would not openly solicit the appointment. He did, however, write Sumner that he would accept it if it were offered and Sumner showed this letter to the President. Lincoln delayed the appointment until after the election. On December 6, he sent Chase\u2019s nomination to the Senate where it was unanimously approved. Seven days later Salmon Portland Chase was sworn in as the sixth Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.", "An often repeated theory about Salmon Chase is that Lincoln appointed him to the Supreme Court to neutralize him as a presidential rival. This seems unfeasible. Chase\u2019s threat to Lincoln in 1864 was totally non-existent by the time of Taney\u2019s death. A threat four years hence was also unrealistic. In addition to the question of Lincoln\u2019s seeking a third term, Chase had never proved a really viable opponent earlier when he was at the height of his political career. In both 1860 and 1864, he had failed to organize an effective campaign and to gain the support of significant party vote-getters. To appoint Chase to the Supreme Court, therefore, would have been an unnecessary political tactic. A better explanation is that Lincoln understood and appreciated Chase. He knew Chase to be consistently loyal to his own principles, especially in his attitude toward slavery and the rights of the black man, and to be religiously conscientious. Unfortunately, this understanding was notably one-sided. After years of much official and some personal association, Chase wrote about the President in his diary: \u201cI feel that I do not know him.\u201d", "Like Ginsburg, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in an election year (2016); and as in 2020, partisan squabbling over the vacancy centered on the election\u2019s outcome and the future of the court.
