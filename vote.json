The basic point is that often precincts are designed to include roughly the same number of voters.

It is difficult to see how there might be some connection to generally occurring political processes. So we may turn to the second significant digits of the vote counts, for which at least there is no similar knock down contrary argument.", "On skeptics.stackexchange.com, one reader\u00a0", " about the Benford\u2019s Law and Biden votes rumor.
