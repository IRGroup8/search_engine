If the R0 is less than one, the outbreak will fizzle out. If it is greater than one, the outbreak will continue. Early estimates place the R0 for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) in the range of two to three. For comparison, the R0 of SARS (a related coronavirus) was two to four when it caused a deadly outbreak in 2003, and the R0 of measles is 12 to 18.", "Imperial College London researchers used an incubation period of 5.1 days in their model, using a similar R number to the one reported in\u00a0", "\u00a0(\u201ca baseline assumption that R0=2.4 but examine values between 2.0 and 2.6\u201d), and assumed that\u00a0\u201cindividuals are assumed to be immune to re-infection in the short term\u201d following recovery from COVID-19.

In such scenarios, given an estimated R0 of 2.4, we predict 81% of the GB and US populations would be infected over the course of the epidemic. Epidemic timings are approximate given the limitations of surveillance data in both countries: The epidemic is predicted to be broader in the US than in GB and to peak slightly later. This is due to the larger geographic scale of the US, resulting in more distinct localised epidemics across states than seen across GB.

They accounted for partial but high compliance with a relaxation of recommended restrictions after several months.", "That suppression model included the closure of schools and universities for months in order to delay a subsequent epidemic during the period before a vaccine became available:", "Once interventions are relaxed (in the example in Figure 3, from September [2020] onwards), infections begin to rise, resulting in a predicted peak epidemic later in the year. The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity.", "Given suppression policies may need to be maintained for many months, we examined the impact of an adaptive policy in which social distancing (plus school and university closure, if used) is only initiated after weekly confirmed case incidence in ICU patients (a group of patients highly likely to be tested) exceeds a certain \u201con\u201d threshold, and is relaxed when ICU case incidence falls below a certain \u201coff\u201d threshold (Figure 4). Case-based policies of home isolation of symptomatic cases and household quarantine (if adopted) are continued throughout.", "Under the modeling scenarios used, suppression policies would be shaped by a fluctuating number of cases. Researchers cited a peak number of cases before capacity for health care services would become overwhelmed and break down:", "Table 3 illustrates that suppression policies are best triggered early in the epidemic, with a cumulative total of 200 ICU cases per week being the latest point at which policies can be triggered and still keep peak ICU demand below GB surge limits in the case of a relatively high R0 value of 2.6. Expected total deaths are also reduced for lower triggers, though deaths for all the policies considered are much lower than for an uncontrolled epidemic. ", " ", "In the \u201cDiscussion\u201d portion of the report, researchers reiterated their recommendations for public health action based on the results of the modeling:", "Overall, our results suggest that population-wide social distancing applied to the population as a whole would have the largest impact; and in combination with other interventions \u2013 notably home isolation of cases and school and university closure \u2013 has the potential to suppress transmission below the threshold of R=1 required to rapidly reduce case incidence. ", " Adaptive hospital surveillance-based triggers for switching on and off population-wide social distancing and school closure offer greater robustness to uncertainty than fixed duration interventions and can be adapted for regional use (e.g. at the state level in the US). Given local epidemics are not perfectly synchronised, local policies are also more efficient and can achieve comparable levels of suppression to national policies while being in force for a slightly smaller proportion of the time.

Imperial College London\u2019s research was predicated in part on flattening the curve for COVID-19, and circumventing a scenario in which capacity was exceeded by unchecked person-to-person spread of the virus.", "Researchers noted that because the strain was new, information and knowledge about the novel coronavirus would be in flux until there was more data. Consequently, they maintained that policies of suppression might change over time \u2014 but not for \u201cseveral months\u201d at least. The researchers also warned that premature relaxation of suppression measures could cause cases of COVID-19 to rapidly rebound, once again threatening to overwhelm health care systems.", "That risk, again, remained until such time a vaccine became widely available:", "However, there are very large uncertainties around the transmission of this virus, the likely effectiveness of different policies and the extent to which the population spontaneously adopts risk reducing behaviours. This means ", ". Future decisions on when and for how long to relax policies will need to be informed by ongoing surveillance.", "The measures used to achieve suppression might also evolve over time. As case numbers fall, it becomes more feasible to adopt intensive testing, contact tracing and quarantine measures akin to the strategies being employed in South Korea today. Technology \u2013 such as mobile phone apps that track an individual\u2019s interactions with other people in society \u2013 might allow such a policy to be more effective and scalable if the associated privacy concerns can be overcome. However, if intensive NPI packages aimed at suppression are not maintained, our analysis suggests that transmission will rapidly rebound, potentially producing an epidemic comparable in scale to what would have been seen had no interventions been adopted.", "The report also indicated that the duration of suppression policies required might be too difficult to implement, discussing the relative efficacy of mitigation versus suppression. In a still relatively disruptive mitigation strategy scenario, the high number of projected deaths would be halved, and demand on healthcare services reduced by a still risky two-thirds:", "Long-term suppression may not be a feasible policy option in many countries. ", " The combination of case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions) are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation. Both case isolation and household quarantine are core epidemiological interventions for infectious disease mitigation and act by reducing the potential for onward transmission through reducing the contact rates of those that are known to be infectious (cases) or may be harbouring infection (household contacts) \u2026 Social distancing of high-risk groups is predicted to be particularly effective at reducing severe outcomes given the strong evidence of an increased risk with age, though we predict it would have less effect in reducing population transmission.", "Researchers reiterated a bleak projected outcome with mitigation strategies in place. Although they anticipated a \u201csingle\u201d and \u201crelatively short\u201d epidemic, health care capacity would be exceeded eight times over, and deaths would number a quarter of a million or more in the UK, and more than a million in the United States:", " (case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of the elderly), ", " for critical care requirements that we examined.
